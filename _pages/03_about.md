Hi, I'm James, a software engineer and Wushu (Chinese Martial Arts) enthusiast from and currently residing in the East Bay.
My dedication to Wushu and programming were initiated during my years at UCLA.
I created this website to store my thoughts and content in both realms.

If you're looking to coordinate martial arts scenes, <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}"> let's talk</a>.
