If you're looking for an awesome tutorial involving lots of buzzwords like REST, API, documentation, and CRUD, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you. No, today's post is on rest. The rest you do when you bury your face in your pillow at night. The thing that calls after a long day at work, a longer ride on an overpacked train, and an empty refrigerator at home. Yup, I'm talking about literally just packing up and taking it easy for the rest of the night. 

### Another Dumb Millenial ###

Since the end of high school, I've had this fantasy dream to one day make the transition from a working software engineer to a martial arts stuntman. As a young, dumb millenial (yes, I know we are the worst generation and are the root of all evil), I've always taken the advice to *follow my dreams* to heart, and found myself in Beijing this summer. After two weeks of getting my ass handed to me by kids who could kick about 5 times faster than me, I decided to get serious when coming home to train and get good. Following the training schedule in Beijing, I've been training two times a day for about the past 2 months or so through martial arts, gymnastics, weight training, and conditioning. And while my training has improved my skill quite a bit in a short period of time, I unfortunately found myself on the floor, barely able to walk just last night. And **why** did this happen? Because I didn't listen to my mom. Gets ya every time.

Fortunately for me, I'm young. Unfortunately for me, I'm stupid. And as such, fellow young and stupid people like myself can often think we're invincible, since we recover easily. Fed from both previous generations and the media, we're told we can do anything. To shoot for the stars. To never give up. And while this is all great advice, I believe that, like anything else, balance is the key to success. 

Not enough socializing and you're desperate to go out with friends. Too much and you're tired and just want to go home. Not enough work and you're bored to death. Too much and you're stressed out. Not enough training and your skills won't improve. And in my case, too much training and you're left on the floor with a blown out back and wobbly knees at the ripe old age of 23.

### A Painful Lesson ###

While being injured really sucks, I learned a valuable lesson from getting injured last night. I am **not** invincible. I (namely my body) will **not** be happy in 10 years if I keep going at this rate. And perhaps most importantly, listening to mom's advice about "being careful", actually may provide some insight. Point being, that even though I endorse working really hard to get what you want, sometimes taking a breather and doing something else is not just healthy, it's necessary. In my case, my body was telling me **STAHP, IT HURTS** when I kept feeling little twitches in my back. And after lying on that floor and thinking to myself "What the hell am I going to do when I get older and I can't recover?", I've decided to take a break and let my body actually heal itself.

If you're a young, dumb millenial like me, you may think you're invincible. You may think nothing will stop you. You may think that as long as you keep charging at that goal, you'll beat the rest of the crowd to the finish line. And in most cases, you're probably right. For now. But realize that if you keep going at 100 miles an hour, you're bound to crash sooner or later. By no means am I justifying slacking off, but realize that life isn't always linear. It isn't just the raw number of hours you practice something that determines if you get good, but also the quality of your practice. So every now and then if you're feeling burnt out and you feel yourself just barely moving along, then by all means throw in the towel...** for now**. And when you come back to the grinding stone, know that you'll just work that much harder now that you've had time to recover.
