Dozens of zipped files lay scattered on my desktop. BTREE_FINAL.c.final was floating next to BTREE_FINAL_WORKING.c. My Gmail was littered with emailed versions of our code. In 3 short hours, our code was due for 30% of our grade, and BTREE_FINAL_3_WORKING.c wasn't working. 

I could practically feel the years of my life slipping away with the stress. It was times like those where I wished I had spent the **30 minutes** required to learn Git.

### Wtf is Git? ##

A `version control system` is a glorified `Save As` button in Microsoft Word. Remember when you needed ten different copies of your resume - RESUME_OLD.doc, RESUME_DONE.doc, or RESUME_FINAL.doc sound familiar? If so, you were using a version control system. Version control systems helps track stable versions of files and the changes between those versions. They also help multiple people collaborate on the same files together - think Google Docs.

Git is just a (nerdy) instance of a version control system. A couple quick commands on a terminal window and you have the power of source control in your hands. No more saving 10 versions of the same document on your computer or ripping half of your hairs out due to frustration - Git has got you covered.

### So Are Git and [Github][github] the Same? ###

[Github][github] and Git are *not* the same thing. Git is a little program that runs on your command line. [GitHub][github] is a big website that allows developers to put their files backed with Git online to share, collaborate on, or just show off with other developers. Think of Git as Microsoft Word on your computer, and GitHub as Google Docs, which can support online sharing of Word documents.

This is **precisely** what I thought in college, regardless of all of the free and interactive resources available to learn Git (check them out at the bottom of the page). And although it would have taken me half an hour to really teach myself basic Git commands, I decided that losing files, clogging my inbox, and freaking out over lost working code was a better alternative. Seriously though, the value of Git is that you can tinker with working versions of files without fear or breaking or losing information - **even if you're not a software developer**.

### TL;DR ###

I wasted a lot of time and energy by **not** learning Git. If you keep telling yourself you'll learn Git *someday*, do yourself a favor and take the hour to teach yourself right now (college students I'm looking at you). [Github][github] is a site that hosts Github projects for collaboration. There's tons of free resources out there to learn and it only takes about 30 minutes, so do yourself a favor and check them out!
